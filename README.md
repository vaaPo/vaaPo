Geeky signature fun stuff copied and massaged to suit my purposes.
Execute from https://www.npmjs.com/package/vaapo with 
npx vaapo

Or be brave and execute directly from github with:
npx vaaPo/vaaPo#master

Idea and code originally from Elijah Manor https://github.com/elijahmanor/elijahmanor

If you would like to fiddle with the source, then just clone it for yourself with:
git clone git@github.com:vaaPo/vaaPo.git
cd vaapo
npm i inquirer
npm i cfonts
npm i opn
npm run start -s

This of course requires you to have ssh-keys in place in Git, but I recommend using ssh because with VisualStudio code you don't have to enter credentials everytime you e.g.push our changes to your own repository.
