Execute from https://www.npmjs.com/package/vaapo with 
<br>npx vaapo

Or be brave and execute directly from github with:
<br>npx vaaPo/vaaPo#master

If you would like to fiddle with the source, then just clone it for yourself with:
<br>git clone git@github.com:vaaPo/vaaPo.git
<br>cd vaapo
<br>npm install
<br>npm run start -s

This of course requires you to have ssh-keys in place in Git, but I recommend using ssh because with VisualStudio code you don't have to enter credentials everytime you e.g.push our changes to your own repository.
